Sailfish SDK Font Size Changer
==============================

Because there is no easy way to switch system font size in Sailfish OS emulator (Sailfish Application SDK), I created this litte app, which does exactly what it says on the tin. This was created and tested on Sailfish Application SDK version 3.0.0.8.

I do not recommend that you install this package on the device, as this is only tested in the emulator. If you choose to do so, make sure you have backups.

Go to releases to download the RPM package and install it using pkcon command.

Have fun!
